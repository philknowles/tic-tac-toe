Introduction to JavaScript with Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a a tic-tac-toe walkthrough for those who have never, I mean NEVER touched code before in their life. I decided to do so as I realise my videos are for those who already have an understanding of JavaScript, and would like to practice and get better by making games, or learning different approaches to solving problems. I am going to go super slow on this one and try to explain as much as I can. Obviously, I’m sure there will be things I miss out, so if you want to ask me anything please comment below and I will get back to you. Remember this video is for you to learn and have an awesome game to show for it by the end.


First off, you need to download the Atom code editor to your laptop. This will allow us to write code in our project files. If you haven’t done so already I suggest heading over to atom.io and pausing right here until it has been downloaded. I have actually made a tutorial on the ideal set up of atom for your project, so if you want a more in-depth walkthrough on the pros of Atom and useful tips - head over to my video now. It also talks us through a little bit about how to use a command-line tool on your computer.

Good luck!
